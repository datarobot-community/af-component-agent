# MCP tools

The agent can call tools served by a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server, in addition to its workflow tools and the tools defined in code. This page describes how the agent finds its MCP server, what it sends to that server, and how the setting reaches a deployed agent.

For where MCP tools are loaded in code, see [MCP tools](./README.md#mcp-tools) and the guide for your framework.

| Section | Description |
|---|---|
| [Point the agent at an MCP server](#point-the-agent-at-an-mcp-server) | The settings, which one wins, and what each sends. |
| [Deployed agents](#deployed-agents) | How the setting reaches the deployed agent. |
| [MCP server deployed with the agent](#mcp-server-deployed-with-the-agent) | Automatic wiring of an MCP server added to the same project. |
| [MCP servers that require Okta XAA](#mcp-servers-that-require-okta-xaa) | The `mcp_client_with_xaa_support` function group. |
| [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) | No MCP tools, and settings that are ignored. |

## Point the agent at an MCP server

Set one of the following in the project's `.env`. When more than one is set, the agent uses the first one in this table.

| Setting | MCP server | Sent to the server |
|---|---|---|
| `MCP_WORKLOAD_ID` | Runs on the DataRobot Workload API. The agent asks the Workload API for the workload's endpoint. | The DataRobot API token as `Authorization` and `x-datarobot-api-key`, and the authorization context |
| `MCP_DEPLOYMENT_ID` | Deployed in DataRobot as a custom model. | The DataRobot API token as `Authorization`, and the authorization context |
| `EXTERNAL_MCP_URL` | Any other endpoint, for example `https://example.com/mcp/`. | Only the headers in `EXTERNAL_MCP_HEADERS` |
| `MCP_SERVER_PORT` | Runs on this machine, at `http://localhost:<port>`. | The DataRobot API token as `Authorization`, and the authorization context |

Workload and deployment IDs are 24 hexadecimal characters. Any other value is ignored, with a warning.

Two more settings apply to `EXTERNAL_MCP_URL` only:

- `EXTERNAL_MCP_HEADERS`: a JSON object of headers, for example `'{"Authorization": "Bearer <token>"}'`.
- `EXTERNAL_MCP_TRANSPORT`: `streamable-http` (default) or `sse`.

With none of these set, the agent uses its other tools only.

## Deployed agents

`dr run deploy` passes `MCP_WORKLOAD_ID`, `MCP_DEPLOYMENT_ID`, `EXTERNAL_MCP_URL`, `EXTERNAL_MCP_HEADERS`, and `EXTERNAL_MCP_TRANSPORT` from `.env` to the deployed agent as [runtime parameters](./runtime-parameters.md), whichever of them are set. `MCP_SERVER_PORT` is not passed, because it only means something on your machine.

To point a deployed agent at another server, change the setting in `.env` and run `dr run deploy` again, or edit the runtime parameter on the deployment in DataRobot.

## MCP server deployed with the agent

A project can also contain an MCP server built from the [DataRobot MCP component](https://github.com/datarobot-community/af-component-datarobot-mcp). When that server is added under the default name `mcp_server`, its infrastructure module `infra/infra/mcp_server.py` exists, and:

- `dr run deploy` deploys the server and, in the server's default serverless deployment mode, connects the deployed agent to it automatically.
- That module decides the deployed agent's MCP settings. The settings in `.env` are not passed to the deployed agent while it exists.

When the server is deployed to the Workload API instead (`ENABLE_MCP_ON_WORKLOAD_API=true`), the module passes no MCP settings, so the deployed agent has no MCP server. An MCP server added under any other name is not connected automatically either. Point the agent at it with `MCP_DEPLOYMENT_ID`.

When the agent runs locally, it always uses the settings in `.env`.

## MCP servers that require Okta XAA

For an MCP server that only accepts Okta cross-application access (XAA) tokens, declare an `mcp_client_with_xaa_support` function group in `workflow.yaml` and add it to the workflow's tools:

```yaml
function_groups:
  mcp_tools_xaa:
    _type: mcp_client_with_xaa_support
    server:
      url: https://<mcp-server-host>/mcp/

workflow:
  tool_names:
    - mcp_tools_xaa
```

The function group reads the server's published XAA requirements and exchanges tokens with the agent's Okta identity, `IDP_AGENT_ID` and `IDP_AGENT_PRIVATE_KEY_JWK`. See [A2A authentication](./agent2agent-auth.md) for those settings.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| The agent answers without MCP tools, and the log has a warning about the MCP server | The server could not be reached. The agent keeps running without MCP tools. | Check that the server is running and that the setting points at it. |
| A setting in `.env` has no effect | A setting higher in the [table](#point-the-agent-at-an-mcp-server) is also set. | Unset the settings you do not use. |
| The deployed agent ignores `MCP_DEPLOYMENT_ID` or `EXTERNAL_MCP_URL` | The project contains `infra/infra/mcp_server.py`. | See [MCP server deployed with the agent](#mcp-server-deployed-with-the-agent). |
| The deployed agent finds no workload server | The agent's API token cannot read the workload, or the workload is not running yet. | Check the workload in DataRobot. The agent looks the endpoint up again on the next request. |
