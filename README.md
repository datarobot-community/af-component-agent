# af-component-agent

The agent template provides a set of utilities for constructing a single or multi-agent flow using platforms such
as CrewAI, LangGraph, LlamaIndex, and others. The template is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing you
to create a wide range of agent-based applications.

The Agent Framework is component from [App Framework Studio](https://github.com/datarobot/app-framework-studio)


* Part of https://datarobot.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/BOPS/pages/6542032899/App+Framework+-+Studio


## Using component

To start for a repo:

`uvx copier copy https://github.com/datarobot/af-component-agent .`

If a template requires multiple agents, it can be used multiple times with a different answer to the `agent_app` question.

To work, it expects the base component https://github.com/datarobot/af-component-base has already been installed. To do that first, run:

`uvx copier copy https://github.com/datarobot/af-component-base .`


To update

`uvx copier update -a .datarobot/answers/agent-{{ agent_app }}.yml -A`

To update all templates that are copied:

`uvx copier update -a .datarobot/answers/* -A`

or just

`uvx copier update -a .datarobot/*`

## Updating component

Every release of this repository requires updating our customer facing agentic templates [recipe-datarobot-agent-templates](https://github.com/datarobot/recipe-datarobot-agent-templates),
because they are autogenerated out of this component. Therefore, if you make changes which change the template, you sync them with the recipe:

1. After merging a PR make a new release [here](https://github.com/datarobot/af-component-agent/releases).
2. Go to `recipe-datarobot-agent-templates`, make a new branch and run `task update-all`.
3. Make a PR to `recipe-datarobot-agent-templates`, and merge your updates.
